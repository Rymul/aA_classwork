        <h2>Authentic Chicken Curry</h2>
        <p>Authentic Indian chicken curry is cooked slowly with patience and love. Bone-in meat, Indian ground & whole spices, ginger-garlic, onion and tomatoes cooked on low heat until tender.</p>

        <p>Working-class families in India do not use heavy cream to create thick creamy curry. It is watered down to make it soupy to go with plain rice or cooked down for thicker curry to serve it with Roti(Indian flat bread).

            Chicken curry is super easy to make. Anyone with beginning cooking skills can create a comforting curry.</p>

                <h2>What's in this Recipe</h2>
                <section>
                    <h3>Meat & Produce:</h3>
                        <p>Bone-in Chicken: an authentic Indian chicken curry is cooked with a whole chicken cut into pieces. Bone-in meat is the essence of Indian meat curries. I highly recommend using whole chicken cut into pieces for this recipe. Boneless chicken breast is a good substitute for bone-in chicken pieces</p>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="https://feastwithsafiya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/chicken-curry-ingredients.jpg"

                            </figure>
                        <p>Tomatoes: I usually like to use pureed Roma or Vine tomatoes. Remove the seeds before pureeing them so you don't have to sieve them.</p>
                        <p>Ginger & Garlic: grate the ginger and garlic or mince them into a food processor. I like to make and store large batches of ginger-garlic paste. It comes in handy in my kitchen.</p>
                        <p>Onion: I like to thinly slice the yellow onion for chicken curry. That's how my mother did. You may run it through the chopper if you like.</p>
                        <p>Oil: a generous amount of oil is a sign of rich and authentic Indian curry. I am using Â½ cup of oil but you may adjust according to your desired quantity.</p>

                    <h3>Whole & Ground Spices</h3>
                        <p>This recipe calls for all the standard Indian-powered spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, Kashmiri chili powder.</p>
                        <p>I am using a blend of whole cinnamon sticks, bay leaves, green cardamom, cloves, and black peppercorn. Adding whole spices are optional but I highly recommend them for enhanced flavors. At least use a cinnamon stick, bay leaf and cardamom if you can.</p>
                        <p>Salt: I am using pink salt and measurements are based on pink salt. Use salt per your taste and the type of salt you may use.</p>
                        <p>Garam Masala: I only use homemade garam masala for any meat curry recipe. My homemade garam masala is the key ingredient of this recipe. Whenever a south Asian has tried my chicken curry, they have always asked for the recipe for my garam masala. It's a game-changer, I promise!</p>

                        <p>Chicken curry is served with plain rice, Indian flatbread, naan, or millet bread.</p>
                        <p>I like to serve it with plain rice or whole wheat pita bread(making my life easier ðŸ˜‰ ) along with green chili, cucumber, and onion raita.</p>
